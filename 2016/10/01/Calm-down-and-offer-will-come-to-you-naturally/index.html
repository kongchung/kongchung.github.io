                        <p>I do not believe that anyone can see this from my resume link, none of us have that kind of patience.</p>
<p>But after a month of chased after offers, i finally got a few tips about this process.</p>
<p>Try to be alone to attend the career talks, people can offer info indeed but they can also disturb your heart and let you miss something really important. When you&#x2019;re totally get alone you will know that you have no one to relay on, you will seize every chance to reveal yourself and also understanding the enterprise you like.</p>
<p>Do not afraid student come from so called better school also never under estimate people who come from so called worse school. Show polite to anyone you meet, and show respect to those who know exactly what they want in particular. Cause you should understand now that we all different and stuff proved by the past is much less than the unknown future.</p>
<p>Do not give up even one tiny small chance, everyone can do even but few can do the above average part. Every choice we make everyday will and is shaping who we are.</p>
<p>I have made a record about the company i met, my intention is to left all of this to my junior fellow but now i think this records is more for myself complete. I am very scared of time and want to preserve any footprint of time i spent.</p>
<p>Among all the company i meet, there are two is quite unusual. And they both the solo company that the notes i take is greater than two pages.</p>
<p>The first is SRCtj, i attend both talk at tju new campus and bebut new campus. I like the atmosphere they brought to me, make me much feel like home than the company i stay 3 months. I hope i can get the chance to work there cause it does my first love in sight. I wikied every thing about that company and the country it belonged, and i admire the achievement they have made. I am glad that i seize the chance twice to encounter this company so i can tell u that i never miss u.</p>
<p>The next company is the magnate of private cloud, i attend it&#x2019;s talk at nku new campus but i left it before its about to finish to catch up the last bus to get back home. I did not pass the first round of resume filter unsurprisingly, but i think i can finally find a way to make up this regret someday. I got My first prize from enterprise talk : a featured T-shirt and i am sure this words will always inspire me to wave ahead.</p>
