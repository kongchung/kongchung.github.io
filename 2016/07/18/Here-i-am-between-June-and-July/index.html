                        <p>I have spent two days to attend a meeting that I do not like and it may last one or two days more. Communicate with others always give me a lot of pressure and make me think a lot. None but now in the middle of a night then I can focus on the inside of me.</p>
<p>I do realize that I have owned this site for about one year long. It was always a dream for me to own a zone of mine where I can demonstrate whatever I want. The last year is quite meaningful for me in many ways, but in total: I am growing into a software engineering in my own rhythm.</p>
<p>Although I did not update too much stuff here, I do pay some of attention here. From the first html and ccs to second some basic PHP and MySQL here I got the third version WordPress.</p>
<p>The host computer is free for two years from AliYun now I have one year left. I only paid little money for my domain name. I am quite concern the cloud virtual host computer stuff, because it will spend some money, so I hope I will earn money myself by then.</p>
<p>Today I also had a thought to buy a new domain name for my lab but till now I do not get much respond, perhaps this is because we all do not realize the relationship with this little harbor, cause in any case we do spend young days together here. I will hold my thought and talk about that later.</p>
<p>I can list many reasons about why I write all of this in English, but I will list none here. Make it a mystery or a habit is much better I think.</p>
<p>July is already here, very glad to see you here. Hope I can relish the days with you.</p>
<p>Just as I always say: Wave Ahead whhura.</p>
