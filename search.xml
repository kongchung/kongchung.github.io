      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The wind that passed between us where did it bring the sorrow from</p><p>The sky we looked up crying was kind of awfully clear</p><p>This two sentences is performed unaccompanied almost the end of the movie</p><p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2013;0907&#x2013;1th view &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><p>I looked forward the movie for a long time. The version i watched is not much clear but still feel the beauty that flowing in the scene.</p><p>I should not trust the trailer anymore, they will misdirect the understanding of the things really happened.</p><p>I only find one bug before the temple, other plot is quite reasonable.</p><p>I am very impressed by the setting of 1.2 thousand years a time, this kind of sci-fi vision can always blossom in his movies.</p><p>But i felt much difficulty to read the corresponding novels, movies is my type.</p><p>The musics in the middle also not my type but the unaccompanied song at end is quite touching.</p><p>I like those who running after dreams, the grandma, the little, the whole women family, i like them all.</p><p>So towards the direction of heart, just wave ahead boldly.</p><p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2013;0908&#x2013;2th view &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><p>I believe that The Garden of Words is also come from Man yoshu, so this Your Name is actually also come form that book. I do not have the copy and the scene is in Japanese so i do not find the original source.</p><p>But the original words of dusk is who is this called: tasogare-doki or tasokare or karetaso or kawatare, is some kind of misted circumstance for sure.</p><p>Just as grandma said: &#x201C;Treasure the experience very much, Dreams fade away after you wake up&#x201D; </p><p>Its very interesting that the girl&#x2019;s family name is Miyamizu and her given name is Mitsuha, so her English name is Mitsuha Miyamizu, but her Japanese name is &#x5BAB;&#x6C34; &#x4E09;&#x53F6; just like Chinese name, the family name is in front of the given name .</p><p>What is tradition i think the grandma give us a very perfect answer:&#x201D;Even if words are lost tradition should be handed down.&#x201D;</p><p>I also feel impressed by the Musubi, you can fine many corresponding things in Chinese culture like Land Deity and Mountain Deity. But at last, tying thread is Musubi, Connecting people is Musubi, The flow of time is Musubi. The Japanese are really good at learning.</p><p>At last the song&#x2019;s lyric, cause i do not speak Japanese so chase the feeling in this English format:</p><p>Just a bit more, a little bit more</p><p>would you&#x2026;</p><p>Just a bit more, a little bit more</p><p>Let&#x2019;s stick together</p><p>We are time-flyer, we are time-climber</p><p>don&#x2019;t wanna be lost in its hide and seek</p><p>I won&#x2019;t let you go, won&#x2019;t never let it go</p><p>My hand finally overtook you</p><p>You&#x2019;re a loud cryer wish I could stop ya</p><p>But when i saw your tears, I knew I was refused</p><p>You cry when you&#x2019;re happy</p><p>You laugh when you&#x2019;re sad</p><p>Because your heart overtook you</p><p>The wind that passed between us where did it bring the sorrow from</p><p>The sky we looked up crying was kind of awfully clear</p><p>Usually hash words of my father felt somehow warm today</p><p>Not knowing how to be kind or smile or talk about dreams</p><p>I had to imitate you all</p><p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2013;0930&#x2013;3th view &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><p>I will leave the marvel stuff just in the film itself.</p><p>And best wishes to bro Makoto, wish you can make as many movies as you want.</p><p>your-name</p>]]></content>

      <title>Here i am between June and July</title>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have spent two days to attend a meeting that I do not like and it may last one or two days more. Communicate with others always give me a lot of pressure and make me think a lot. None but now in the middle of a night then I can focus on the inside of me.</p><p>I do realize that I have owned this site for about one year long. It was always a dream for me to own a zone of mine where I can demonstrate whatever I want. The last year is quite meaningful for me in many ways, but in total: I am growing into a software engineering in my own rhythm.</p><p>Although I did not update too much stuff here, I do pay some of attention here. From the first html and ccs to second some basic PHP and MySQL here I got the third version WordPress.</p><p>The host computer is free for two years from AliYun now I have one year left. I only paid little money for my domain name. I am quite concern the cloud virtual host computer stuff, because it will spend some money, so I hope I will earn money myself by then.</p><p>Today I also had a thought to buy a new domain name for my lab but till now I do not get much respond, perhaps this is because we all do not realize the relationship with this little harbor, cause in any case we do spend young days together here. I will hold my thought and talk about that later.</p><p>I can list many reasons about why I write all of this in English, but I will list none here. Make it a mystery or a habit is much better I think.</p><p>July is already here, very glad to see you here. Hope I can relish the days with you.</p><p>Just as I always say: Wave Ahead whhura.</p>]]></content>
